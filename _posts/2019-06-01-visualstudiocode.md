Since many years, I love Visual Studio Code ! Don't be confused with Microsoft Visual Studio please, even Visual Studio Code is an awesome software from Microsoft.

I will not explain you how to use Visual Studio Code, but I'll share with you some nice plugin. Indeed, since some months, I can use VSCode with our main project because someone found the best PHP Plugin even!

- Version: 1.0.14
- Publisher: Ben Mewburn

This one is the magic plugin ! I tried an another one : `PHP IntelliSense` but I don't know why, the autocompletion feature don't work with our main project @Hosco. If you want to work with PHP in VSCode, you should give a try to this plugin.
